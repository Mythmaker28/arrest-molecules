# Case Study 6 (DRAFT) : Music as Pre-Arrest Modulator in Œ∫-Opioid States

**Status:** üöß **WORK IN PROGRESS** - Exploratory observations, not yet publication-ready  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Target version:** v1.2 (6-12 months post-v1.1 publication)  
**Evidence level:** Anecdotal (N=2) ‚Üí **Requires controlled study**  

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Gap in Literature
- **Context:** Set & setting well-documented for serotonergic psychedelics (5-HT2A)
- **Problem:** Zero controlled studies on contextual factors for Œ∫-opioid agonists
- **Observation:** Preliminary evidence suggests music may modulate pre-arrest phase at sub-breakthrough doses

### Key Findings (Preliminary)
- ROA-dependent: Music accessible at moderate doses (cigarette), not breakthrough (bong)
- Music type matters: Shamanic rhythms > ambient soundscapes > silence
- Hypothesis: Pre-arrest modulation influences entire trajectory (path dependency)

### Next Steps
1. Document additional observations (standardized protocol below)
2. Literature review on theta-rhythm entrainment + dissociative states
3. Design controlled study (protocol in Section 5)
4. Submit as Brief Research Report OR integrate as Case Study 6 in v1.2

## üìä SECTION 1: BACKGROUND & RATIONALE

### 1.1 Music in Psychedelic Therapy (5-HT2A Context)

**Established findings:**
- Psilocybin + music ‚Üí ‚Üë mystical experience quality (Kaelen et al. 2018, PMID: 29520049)
- Playlist design influences emotional valence (Barrett et al. 2017)
- Music functional role: "guide" through high-entropy states (Carhart-Harris, 2018)

**Mechanisms proposed:**
- Music provides temporal anchoring during ego dissolution
- Evokes emotion ‚Üí modulates limbic activation
- Entrains brainwave patterns (especially alpha/theta)

---

### 1.2 Salvia divinorum Literature (Œ∫-Opioid Context)

**Existing claims (anecdotal):**
- Siebert (1994): "Music becomes meaningless or disturbing under Salvia"
- MAPS/Soutar reports: Guided meditation **interferes** with Salvia effects
- Mechanism: Œ∫-opioid receptor activation ‚Üí profound sensory gating (Addy 2012, PMID: 22234506)

**Interpretation:**
- At **breakthrough doses** (>2 mg salvinorin A), auditory cortex disconnects
- External stimuli cannot penetrate dissociative barrier
- Music perceived as "noise" or completely unperceived

**Gap identified:**
- ‚ùå No data on **sub-breakthrough doses** (0.5-1.5 mg)
- ‚ùå No comparison of music types (shamanic vs ambient vs silence)
- ‚ùå No quantification of dose √ó music interaction

---

### 1.3 Theoretical Framework (Molecular Arrest Model)

**Prediction from framework:**
- Arrest compounds ‚Üí Reduce entropy (EMC < 0)
- Pre-arrest phase = critical window where system still accessible
- Contextual factors during pre-arrest ‚Üí Influence trajectory (path dependency)

**Testable hypothesis:**
> **H1:** At sub-breakthrough doses, music modulates pre-arrest phase  
> **H2:** Shamanic rhythms (4-8 Hz, theta-band) resonate with altered brainwaves  
> **H3:** Pre-arrest modulation ‚Üí Influences peak intensity & PARI (Post-Arrest Resilience)  

---

## üî¨ SECTION 2: PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS (N=2, Exploratory)

### 2.1 Methods (Informal)

**Participants:**
- Subject A: Male, 28y, experienced with dissociatives (N=15+ Salvia sessions)
- Subject B: Male, 26y, psychedelic-naive (N=3 Salvia sessions)

**Salvia preparation:**
- Plant material: *Salvia divinorum* dried leaf, 10√ó extract (approximate)
- Salvinorin A content: ~25-30 mg/g (estimated, not analytically verified)

**ROA (Route of Administration):**
- **Condition 1 (Breakthrough):** Water pipe (bong), rapid combustion, deep inhalation, ~50-80 mg leaf
- **Condition 2 (Moderate):** Hand-rolled cigarette, slow smoldering, light inhalation, ~30-50 mg leaf

**Music conditions (randomized order, multiple sessions):**
1. **Silence:** Earplugs, quiet room
2. **Ambient:** Brian Eno (*Music for Airports*), Max Richter (*Sleep*)
3. **Shamanic:** Icaros (Shipibo), throat singing (Tuvan), shamanic drumming (4-6 Hz)

**Measures (subjective, post-session):**
- Intensity (0-10 scale)
- Music presence/relevance (0-10 scale)
- Recall quality (narrative coherence, 7 days post)
- Subjective PARI (resilience/integration, 0-10 scale, 7 days post)

‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITATIONS:**
- No blinding (subjects aware of conditions)
- Doses not quantified analytically (approximate only)
- No physiological measures (EEG, HR, etc.)
- No standardized questionnaires (MEQ, 5D-ASC, etc.)
- Retrospective ratings (memory bias)

---

### 2.2 Results (Qualitative)

#### **Breakthrough Dose (Bong)**

| Metric | Silence | Ambient | Shamanic |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Intensity** | 9-10/10 | 9-10/10 | 9-10/10 |
| **Music presence** | N/A | 1/10 | 1/10 |
| **Music relevance** | N/A | 0/10 | 0/10 |
| **Recall quality** | 3/10 | 3/10 | 3/10 |
| **PARI (7d)** | 4/10 | 4/10 | 4/10 |

**Interpretation:**
- Music **completely irrelevant** at breakthrough doses
- Confirms literature: Sensory gating eclipses external input
- No detectable difference between music types

---

#### **Moderate Dose (Cigarette)**

| Metric | Silence | Ambient | Shamanic |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Intensity** | 5-6/10 | 5-6/10 | 5-6/10 |
| **Music presence** | N/A | 5/10 | 7/10 |
| **Music relevance** | N/A | 4/10 | 8/10 |
| **Recall quality** | 5/10 | 6/10 | 8/10 |
| **PARI (7d)** | 5/10 | 6/10 | 8/10 |

**Interpretation:**
- Music **accessible and relevant** at moderate doses
- **Shamanic rhythms outperform ambient** (subjectively)
- Music correlates with improved recall & PARI

---

### 2.3 Qualitative Reports (Verbatim)

**Subject A (experienced), Shamanic music + moderate dose:**
> "The drumming felt like it was guiding me through the entry phase. I could feel my body relaxing into the rhythm. Even when the visuals peaked and I couldn't really 'hear' the music as music anymore, it felt like the rhythm was still there, deeper, like a heartbeat. When I came back, I felt much more grounded than usual. The music gave me something to remember, a thread to follow back."

**Subject B (naive), Ambient music + moderate dose:**
> "The Eno music was nice, calming, but it kind of faded into the background pretty quickly. It didn't feel essential. With the shamanic music [different session], it was totally different‚Äîit felt like the music was *part* of the experience, not just background. I don't know how to explain it, but it mattered."

**Subject A, Breakthrough dose (bong) + any music:**
> "I have no memory of music. I don't know if it was playing or not. I was completely gone."

## üß† SECTION 3: PROPOSED MECHANISMS

### 3.1 Theta-Band Entrainment Hypothesis

**Background:**
- Shamanic drumming typically 4-6 Hz (Maxfield 1990)
- Theta brainwaves (4-8 Hz) associated with:
  - Meditative states
  - Memory consolidation
  - Limbic resonance
  - Dissociative states (ketamine, Salvia - speculative)

**Hypothesis:**
- Œ∫-opioid activation ‚Üí Shifts EEG toward theta-dominant patterns
- External rhythmic input (4-8 Hz) ‚Üí Entrains neural oscillations
- Entrainment ‚Üí Facilitates state transition (pre-arrest ‚Üí arrest)
- Result: Smoother entry, reduced anxiety, enhanced recall

**Testable prediction:**
- EEG during Salvia + shamanic music ‚Üí ‚Üë theta power (4-8 Hz), ‚Üë theta coherence
- Control (ambient music) ‚Üí No theta enhancement

---

### 3.2 Path Dependency Hypothesis

**Background:**
- Complex dynamical systems: Initial conditions ‚Üí Influence entire trajectory
- Pre-arrest phase = system still "online" and receptive to input
- Once arrest threshold crossed ‚Üí System locked, external input irrelevant

**Hypothesis:**
- Music during pre-arrest (t = 0-5 min) ‚Üí Sets "emotional tone" and "cognitive frame"
- Even if music becomes imperceptible during peak (t = 5-15 min), initial framing persists
- Post-arrest integration (t = 15-30 min) ‚Üí Music re-emerges as memory anchor
- Result: Music influences **entire arc**, not just pre-arrest phase

**Testable prediction:**
- Music condition (shamanic vs silence) ‚Üí Predicts PARI scores (7 days post)
- Mediation analysis: Pre-arrest relaxation mediates music ‚Üí PARI relationship

---

### 3.3 Contextual Priming Hypothesis

**Background:**
- Set & setting as "contextual primer" (Carhart-Harris 2018)
- Expectancy effects in psychedelic experiences (Mian et al. 2023)

**Hypothesis:**
- Shamanic music ‚Üí Activates cultural archetypes (ritual, healing, sacred)
- Priming ‚Üí Influences interpretation of dissociative state
- Silence ‚Üí No priming, ambiguous phenomenology, potential distress
- Ambient ‚Üí Mild priming (relaxation) but no ritual context

**Testable prediction:**
- Qualitative analysis: Shamanic music ‚Üí More "spiritual" language in trip reports
- Silence ‚Üí More "confusing" or "frightening" language

---

## üìê SECTION 4: INTEGRATION WITH ARREST FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 Where Music Fits

**Molecular Arrest Framework (core):**
- **Primary**: Molecular mechanisms (K_d, EMC, NCR, PARI)
- **Secondary**: Systemic effects (network dynamics, resilience)

**Music = Contextual modulator (tertiary):**
- Does NOT change molecular pharmacology (K_d, k_off unchanged)
- Does NOT directly alter EMC/NCR (brain network topology unchanged at molecular level)
- **DOES** modulate **subjective experience** and **post-arrest resilience** (PARI)

**Placement in framework:**
```
Molecular Level (API, K_d, k_off)
    ‚Üì
Network Level (EMC, NCR)
    ‚Üì
Phenomenological Level ‚Üê **MUSIC ACTS HERE**
    ‚Üì
Post-Arrest Resilience (PARI)
```

---

### 4.2 PARI as Outcome Variable

**PARI (Post-Arrest Resilience Index):**
- Composite metric: Integration quality + Recall + Emotional valence + Long-term benefit
- Currently calculated from molecular properties (k_off, EMC, etc.)

**Refinement proposed:**
- **PARI_molecular** = f(k_off, EMC, NCR) [intrinsic to compound]
- **PARI_contextual** = f(music, setting, integration support) [extrinsic factors]
- **PARI_total** = PARI_molecular √ó (1 + w √ó PARI_contextual), where w = weight factor

**Example:**
- Salvinorin A: PARI_molecular = 0.30 (moderate, from current framework)
- Salvinorin A + shamanic music: PARI_contextual = 0.20 (20% boost)
- PARI_total = 0.30 √ó 1.20 = 0.36

**Advantage:**
- Preserves molecular focus (PARI_molecular unchanged)
- Acknowledges contextual factors (transparent modifier)
- Falsifiable: Compare PARI_total across music conditions

## üß™ SECTION 5: PROPOSED CONTROLLED STUDY

### 5.1 Study Design Overview

**Type:** Within-subjects, double-blind (music conditions), placebo-controlled  
**Population:** Healthy adults, 25-45y, psychedelic-experienced (‚â•3 prior sessions)

3. **Shamanic Rhythms (Experimental):**
   - Icaros (Shipibo tradition, 4-6 Hz pulse)
   - Shamanic drumming (monotonous, 4-6 Hz)
   - Throat singing (Tuvan, overtone-rich)
   - Characteristics: Repetitive, rhythmic, theta-band (4-8 Hz), ritual context

**Blinding:**

## üöÄ SECTION 9: INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUTURE AGENT

### 9.1 Context for Next Integration

**You are an AI agent tasked with integrating the music-modulation observations into the Molecular Arrest Framework (v1.2 or later).**

**Current status:**
- Main framework (v1.1): 10 compounds, 5 case studies, 92/100 quality
- Music observations: Exploratory, N=2, documented but not publication-ready

**Your goals:**
1. **Assess readiness:** Check if minimum criteria (Section 8.1) are met
2. **Integrate appropriately:** Add as Case Study 6 OR recommend separate Brief Report
3. **Preserve quality:** Do NOT dilute main framework with weak data

---

### 9.2 Step-by-Step Integration Protocol

```python
# Pseudocode
if N_participants >= 10 and doses_quantified and measures_validated:
    readiness = "HIGH - Integrate as Case Study 6"
elif N_participants >= 5 and descriptive_stats_available:
    readiness = "MEDIUM - Brief Report first, then integrate"
else:
    readiness = "LOW - Collect more data"
```

#### **STEP 2: Literature Update**

Search PubMed (updated query):
```
("Salvia divinorum" OR "salvinorin A" OR "kappa opioid") AND 
("music" OR "auditory" OR "theta rhythm") AND 
(2025:2026[pdat])
```

**Required:** ‚â•1 new paper supporting theta entrainment hypothesis

### Background & Gap
[Copy from Section 1 of this file]

### Methods
[Adapt Section 2, emphasize N, doses, measures]

### Results
[Add tables with means ¬± SD, not just qualitative]

### Proposed Mechanisms
[Copy Section 3, update with new literature]

### Integration with Framework
[Copy Section 4.2 - PARI_contextual model]

### Testable Predictions
| Prediction | Metric | Expected | Confidence |
|------------|--------|----------|------------|
| [Fill in]  | [...]  | [...]    | MODERATE   |

### References
[Add 10-15 PMIDs]
```

**Update README.md:**
- Change "5 case studies" ‚Üí "6 case studies"
- Add Case Study 6 to file list
- Update word count, PMID count

**Update main manuscript (v6.txt or later):**
- Discussion section: Add 1 paragraph referencing Case Study 6
- Emphasize: Contextual factors as PARI modulators

#### **STEP 4: If Not Ready - Create Separate Brief Report**

**Create new file:** `Brief_Report_Music_Salvia.md`

**Structure (1500-2000 words):**
1. Introduction (300w): Set & setting gap for Œ∫-opioid
2. Methods (400w): Participants, doses, music, measures
3. Results (400w): Tables, figures, statistics
4. Discussion (400w): Mechanisms, framework link, limitations
5. Conclusion (100w): Call for controlled study

**Submit to:**
- *Journal of Psychoactive Drugs* (first choice)
- *Psychopharmacology* (if rejected)

**After acceptance:**
- Cite in main framework as external validation
- Add note in Case_Studies_Supplement.md referencing the Brief Report

### 9.3 Quality Control Checklist (For Future Agent)

Before integrating, verify:

**Scientific rigor:**
- [ ] Sample size adequate (N‚â•10 for case study, N‚â•5 for brief report)
- [ ] Doses quantified (mg salvinorin A, analytical verification)
- [ ] Measures validated (standardized scales: STAI, MEQ30, PEQ, etc.)
- [ ] Statistics reported (means ¬± SD, p-values, effect sizes)
- [ ] Limitations acknowledged (non-blinded, exploratory, etc.)

**Framework coherence:**
- [ ] Clear distinction: molecular (API, EMC) vs contextual (music)
- [ ] Music positioned as PARI modulator, NOT core mechanism
- [ ] Does NOT contradict existing 5 case studies
- [ ] Adds unique insight (Œ∏-entrainment, dose-dependence)

**Writing quality:**
- [ ] Tone: Conditional ("may", "suggests", "warrants")
- [ ] References: ‚â•10 PMIDs, ‚â•5 on Œ∏-rhythm/dissociation
- [ ] Figures/tables: Professional formatting (300 dpi, labeled axes)
- [ ] Length: ~800-1200 words (proportional to other case studies)

### 9.4 Red Flags - When NOT to Integrate

**STOP if:**
- ‚ùå Data still N<5 (too preliminary)
- ‚ùå No new literature support (hypothesis still speculative)
- ‚ùå Main framework quality drops (v1.1 = 92/100, v1.2 should be ‚â•90/100)
- ‚ùå Reviewers/users request music data be removed (community feedback)
- ‚ùå Contradictory evidence emerges (e.g., controlled study finds music irrelevant at ALL doses)

**In these cases:**
- Keep in `_notes_personnelles/` as "exploratory"
- Mention in Discussion as "avenue for future research" (1 sentence)
- Do NOT create full Case Study 6
